# bunny-hunter
## Final Project: Jackals hunt rabbits right?

- Map a room or other enclosed area
- Explore the map looking for bunnies, each will have an associated Alvar marker.
- Set the bunny location as waypoints in the map.
- Return to the starting point and pose.
- At the starting point you will find an Alvar marker matching one of the bunnies.
- Proceed to that waypoint.
- Count the number and color of each Easter Egg in the bunny's basket. The basket and eggs will be situated similar to the image above.
- Return to the starting point.
- Provide some sort of visual display, pop-up, with the number of eggs and location (i.e. Alvar marker #).
- Final presentations on April 19.
